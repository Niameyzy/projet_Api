CE QUE NOUS POUVONS ACCOMPLIR ENSEMBLE

Dans le cadre de la transformation numérique du groupe Thales, un data catalogue a été déployé au niveau groupe avec une intégration métier dans les GBUs via les CDOs.

L’objectif du data catalogue est d’être un inventaire intelligent et pratique de toutes les données de l’entreprise (métadonnées) et de permettre la démocratisation, le contrôle et la collaboration autour des sujets data.

Thales a choisi l’outil DataGalaxy qui s’articule autour de quatre modules : glossaire métier, inventaire des usages, dictionnaire technique, répertoire des flux et transformations.

Vos missions articuleront autour des critères de succès et objectifs suivants :
• L’automatisation des processus opérationnels permet un gain de temps important
• Les formations sont disponibles dans le catalogue des formations digitales de l’entreprise et supportent le déploiement de l’outil
• Les dashboards permettent la prise de décisions, vis-à-vis de la roadmap de l’outil et du déploiement de la data gouvernance dans l’entreprise, sur la base d’informations sures et contrôlées

Prose, c’est une start up de la beauty tech “born in Paris, made in New York” qui révolutionne l’industrie cosmétique.

- Support lors de la mise en place des tests consommateurs
- Analyser des résultats de ces tests
Tu pourras également prendre en charge d’autres analyses sur des sujets variés.

Profil recherché

- Tu cherches un stage de fin d’étude pour valider ta formation Bac + 5 de type Grande École d’ingénieur ou de commerce.
- Tu parles aussi bien anglais que tu ne codes python ou R.

• *Allianz Direct France x Luko, Who are we?We created Luko with a simple vision.50% of consumers don’t trust their insurer, yet it is mandatory in many cases and it is the only stakeholder you can turn to when damage occurs in your home. So we decided to reinvent insurance to make it finally customer-centric like we believe it was meant to be.We started by creating the most transparent and useful insurance company out there: one that you can finally trust, because its business model was designed for positive impact and because its product experience is meant to empower users rather than mislead them.We created the most intuitive and user-obsessed insurance experience you can wish for: subscription in 2 minutes, a simple offer, customisable coverages, no hidden fees, policies without any engagement, termination in 3 clicks.In 6 years, we have convinced over 400,000 users to trust us. We rapidly became the online home insurance market, putting technology at the service of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency: by 2022, 25% of home insurance policies sold online in France were Luko policies; and nearly one in two new Luko customers took out a policy on the recommendation of friends and family.In February 2024, Luko joins Allianz Direct, the digital pan-European subsidiary of the Allianz Group, to become the market leader in direct home insurance in France. This makes Luko emerging the strongest neo-insurer. Together, and because Luko and Allianz Direct share a common vision and DNA, we will continue our mission to shake up the market by offering the best value for money and even more simplicity and transparency.Allianz Direct DNABecoming part of the Allianz Direct organisation means that you have a match with our DNA.

• *Allianz Direct France x Luko, Who are we?We created Luko with a simple vision.50% of consumers don’t trust their insurer, yet it is mandatory in many cases and it is the only stakeholder you can turn to when damage occurs in your home. So we decided to reinvent insurance to make it finally customer-centric like we believe it was meant to be.We started by creating the most transparent and useful insurance company out there: one that you can finally trust, because its business model was designed for positive impact and because its product experience is meant to empower users rather than mislead them.We created the most intuitive and user-obsessed insurance experience you can wish for: subscription in 2 minutes, a simple offer, customisable coverages, no hidden fees, policies without any engagement, termination in 3 clicks.In 6 years, we have convinced over 400,000 users to trust us. We rapidly became the online home insurance market, putting technology at the service of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency: by 2022, 25% of home insurance policies sold online in France were Luko policies; and nearly one in two new Luko customers took out a policy on the recommendation of friends and family.In February 2024, Luko joins Allianz Direct, the digital pan-European subsidiary of the Allianz Group, to become the market leader in direct home insurance in France. This makes Luko emerging the strongest neo-insurer. Together, and because Luko and Allianz Direct share a common vision and DNA, we will continue our mission to shake up the market by offering the best value for money and even more simplicity and transparency.Allianz Direct DNABecoming part of the Allianz Direct organisation means that you have a match with our DNA.

Swan is the leading European fintech specialized in embedded banking. A laureate of the French government's selective year list of tech champions, ""French Tech Next 120,"" we are quickly expanding across Europe.

Over 100 European companies have already seamlessly integrated banking services such as accounts, cards, and payments into their products through our Banking-as-a-Service platform. This approach, known as “embedded finance”, empowers businesses to elevate their offerings and create new revenue streams — often times tripling their revenue!

Our founders' vision from the beginning was Simplicity: that anyone with a fintech idea at 2 am can visit our website, start building, and buy themselves a coffee with a self-issued card the very next day. That vision has taken us far.

Following a 38M€ Series B round last September, we have been doubling our headcount and already have over 230 Swanees across offices in Paris, Bordeaux, Berlin, Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Milan! If you’re excited about joining a European fintech adventure, Swan is the way!

• Formulate problems considering available data and project constraints.
• Explore and review existing approaches or relevant associated scientific literature.
• Design, implement and test algorithms.
• Continuously provide ideas to improve products and take part in all team discussions.
• Grow a culture around remote sensing data.

The ability to use data analytics to make better business decisions is a valuable skill that’s in high demand. Freelance data analysts are capable of working with large volumes of data, processing it in its raw format, analyzing it, and arriving at certain conclusions for the purpose of organizational planning and problem-solving.

If you enjoy working with large volumes of data to glean insights designed to help client organizations with their decision-making, you might have what it takes to be a freelance data analyst on Upwork.

What does a freelance data analyst do?

Freelance data analysts work with client organizations by taking large volumes of data, cleaning it, interpreting it, and presenting it in order to answer a particular question or provide a solution to a problem. Data engineers typically work with computer software and programming languages like python to process data and deliver key insights to business analysts.

Data engineers also have a number of tools at their disposal, including SQL consoles, data modeling tools, statistical analysis tools, and business intelligence platforms. A number of business intelligence platforms, such as Tableau and Microsoft Power BI, enable freelance data analysts to deliver critical data and information in a way that is visually stunning and easily understood.

What skills do I need to become a freelance data analyst?

Clients hire freelance data analysts for their unique set of skills. When you’re on a freelance data analyst career path, no two clients or projects will be alike, but there are some common data analyst skills that clients look for in a data analyst role.

A data analyst job description will likely have some of these core traits:
• Critical thinking skills. While freelance data analysts use the latest technology and software to glean helpful information from complex data, meaningful insights and solutions would not be possible without first possessing critical thinking skills.
• Data visualization skills. Data visualization allows freelancers to present complex information with shapes, sizes, colors, and text, allowing clients to grasp information quickly and make key decisions without delay.
• Programming capability. While freelance data analysts aren’t required to be hard-core computer programmers, having familiarity with certain programming languages and being able to handle a straightforward programming fix is an invaluable skill to have.
• Familiarity with SQL. Large volumes of data sets and database work go hand-in-hand. By knowing their way around an SQL database, freelance data analysts can maximize their value, creating client solutions that handle large volumes of data efficiently and through easy-to-use desktop database tools.
• Problem-solving skills. Data analysis and problem-solving are virtually interchangeable. Freelancers that excel in problem-solving always find solutions to their client’s most pressing dilemmas. Whether through an SQL database or an interactive dashboard, data analysts can use their problem-solving skills to find answers to the toughest client questions.
• Project management skills. Whether building an SQL database or processing data through a business intelligence tool, project management skills are an essential capability for competitive freelance data analysts. Successfully shepherding a project from market research to product development will help you be that much more desirable to future clients.
• Attention to detail. When dealing with data, one wrong number can invalidate all conclusions and recommendations from a data set. It’s incumbent upon the freelance data engineers to make sure they pay attention to things like types of data and data sources to make sure the insights they’re gleaming are correct.

What are the core freelance data analyst job responsibilities?

While analyzing data and presenting findings are perhaps the most important responsibilities, there are other tasks data analysts take on when hired for various projects.

The core responsibilities freelance data analysts typically handle during an engagement include the following:
• Collect and analyze customer data to determine product and services preferences
• Oversee deployments regarding new processes and data fields for production
• Develop and manage all data visualization presentations for executive updates
• Technical skills to establish and maintain standardizations around data processing, analysis, and solution coding
• Ensure data accuracy used for reports and presentations
• Manage automated backup of all data housed across multiple database systems and engines.
• Collaborate with team members and other data scientists within the research department as well as stakeholders across the organization.

Should I get a degree or certification to become a freelance data analyst?

In addition to developing your skills via employer or client work, it is essential to obtain a degree and/or professional certification to help your Upwork profile stand out and ensure you have the most essential data analyst skills.

Some examples of popular freelance data analyst degrees or certifications include:
• Bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in data science, mathematics, finance, statistics, computer science, economics, psychology, management information systems, or an equivalent in a related field of study from an accredited college or university
• Certification of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences—offered by Columbia University Data Science Institute

The ability to use data analytics to make better business decisions is a valuable skill that’s in high demand. Freelance data analysts are capable of working with large volumes of data, processing it in its raw format, analyzing it, and arriving at certain conclusions for the purpose of organizational planning and problem-solving.

If you enjoy working with large volumes of data to glean insights designed to help client organizations with their decision-making, you might have what it takes to be a freelance data analyst on Upwork.

What does a freelance data analyst do?

Freelance data analysts work with client organizations by taking large volumes of data, cleaning it, interpreting it, and presenting it in order to answer a particular question or provide a solution to a problem. Data engineers typically work with computer software and programming languages like python to process data and deliver key insights to business analysts.

Data engineers also have a number of tools at their disposal, including SQL consoles, data modeling tools, statistical analysis tools, and business intelligence platforms. A number of business intelligence platforms, such as Tableau and Microsoft Power BI, enable freelance data analysts to deliver critical data and information in a way that is visually stunning and easily understood.

What skills do I need to become a freelance data analyst?

Clients hire freelance data analysts for their unique set of skills. When you’re on a freelance data analyst career path, no two clients or projects will be alike, but there are some common data analyst skills that clients look for in a data analyst role.

A data analyst job description will likely have some of these core traits:
• Critical thinking skills. While freelance data analysts use the latest technology and software to glean helpful information from complex data, meaningful insights and solutions would not be possible without first possessing critical thinking skills.
• Data visualization skills. Data visualization allows freelancers to present complex information with shapes, sizes, colors, and text, allowing clients to grasp information quickly and make key decisions without delay.
• Programming capability. While freelance data analysts aren’t required to be hard-core computer programmers, having familiarity with certain programming languages and being able to handle a straightforward programming fix is an invaluable skill to have.
• Familiarity with SQL. Large volumes of data sets and database work go hand-in-hand. By knowing their way around an SQL database, freelance data analysts can maximize their value, creating client solutions that handle large volumes of data efficiently and through easy-to-use desktop database tools.
• Problem-solving skills. Data analysis and problem-solving are virtually interchangeable. Freelancers that excel in problem-solving always find solutions to their client’s most pressing dilemmas. Whether through an SQL database or an interactive dashboard, data analysts can use their problem-solving skills to find answers to the toughest client questions.
• Project management skills. Whether building an SQL database or processing data through a business intelligence tool, project management skills are an essential capability for competitive freelance data analysts. Successfully shepherding a project from market research to product development will help you be that much more desirable to future clients.
• Attention to detail. When dealing with data, one wrong number can invalidate all conclusions and recommendations from a data set. It’s incumbent upon the freelance data engineers to make sure they pay attention to things like types of data and data sources to make sure the insights they’re gleaming are correct.

What are the core freelance data analyst job responsibilities?

While analyzing data and presenting findings are perhaps the most important responsibilities, there are other tasks data analysts take on when hired for various projects.

The core responsibilities freelance data analysts typically handle during an engagement include the following:
• Collect and analyze customer data to determine product and services preferences
• Oversee deployments regarding new processes and data fields for production
• Develop and manage all data visualization presentations for executive updates
• Technical skills to establish and maintain standardizations around data processing, analysis, and solution coding
• Ensure data accuracy used for reports and presentations
• Manage automated backup of all data housed across multiple database systems and engines.
• Collaborate with team members and other data scientists within the research department as well as stakeholders across the organization.

Should I get a degree or certification to become a freelance data analyst?

In addition to developing your skills via employer or client work, it is essential to obtain a degree and/or professional certification to help your Upwork profile stand out and ensure you have the most essential data analyst skills.

Some examples of popular freelance data analyst degrees or certifications include:
• Bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in data science, mathematics, finance, statistics, computer science, economics, psychology, management information systems, or an equivalent in a related field of study from an accredited college or university
• Certification of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences—offered by Columbia University Data Science Institute

Criteo is in search of a passionate, highly motivated Intern to join our Insights & Marketing Analytics (IMAX) team in Barcelona. The IMAX team is a specialized, global team of insights and analytics professionals located in Barcelona. This global team is responsible for the insights that fuel Criteo-created content; the creation, execution, and analysis of customer, shopper, and marketer surveys; the analysis of Criteo’s own paid media; and the evangelization of data-driven methods and data storytelling across all of Criteo. While the IMAX team directly supports the needs of the global Marketing team, we also interface with commercially-facing teams (such as Sales and Account Strategy), with Criteo clients, and with the marketplace itself via conferences, via the press, and via industry influencers.

You will be working closely with the global Marketing team to create the insights that fuel our message in the marketplace. You will contribute to the analysis behind some of our most important pieces of recurring and ad-hoc thought leadership. You will see your work directly cited in the press, at industry conferences, and by our commercial teams. Examples of such work are available on our website.
• Our Travel Reports at https://www.criteo.com/blog/global-travel-industry-trends-2024/
• Our ROAS Trap Report at https://go.criteo.com/en/the-roas-trap/
• Our Interactive Commerce Dashboard at: https://www.criteo.com/blog/commerce-trends-dashboard/
• And many exclusive deliverables for internal teams, clients, analysts and reporters.

You’ll work closely with the IMAX and Content teams to turn Criteo’s extraordinary commerce dataset into market-facing insights. You will also directly support Criteo’s in-house surveys of customers, shoppers, and marketers, on a global basis. You will create, launch, and maintain interactive tools using Tableau (or other technologies) that allow the broader set of global Criteos to access your work at scale.

The position combines traditional technical data analytics work, including the use of SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, with the “softer” part of data science: storytelling with data.

This position involves dealing with a considerable amount of complex, real-world data and requires a candidate who is comfortable thinking of new and innovative ways to analyze data and solve problems. The ideal candidate will be enthusiastic about data storytelling and embrace the concept of the “full stack” data analytics professional as a career choice.

What you will be doing

• Develop automations in Python to increase department efficiency and allow projects to scale

• Develop a deep knowledge of how to analyze trends across client, product groups, and verticals in all of Criteo’s global markets

• Understand how Criteo creates data across various data stores (Vertica / Hive / Presto). Become a point person regarding the meaning of data and best practices around data access.

• Contribute to new ways of using Criteo’s vast storehouse of data, including developing higher quality approaches to existing offerings as well as innovating to create new market-worthy content “from scratch.”

• Liaise with other teams as needed, including non-IMAX Analytics, Product Marketing, Sales, and Account Strategy

• Work with IMAX and Marketing team members to develop our strategic approach to content. Align our initiatives with Criteo’s overall direction and ensure that IMAX projects contribute to business results.

• This role will also provide the opportunity to create custom tables in databases, to support IMAX data for the global Criteo analytics community, to own and maintain reports/code in Tableau, Python or other relevant technologies.

Who You Are:

• Bachelor’s degree or higher in a quantitative field (Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Economics, etc.)

• Strong interest in combining analytical/technical skills with softer/communication skills

• Strong interest in AI solutions such as ChatGPT,Cursor, Perplexity.

• Relevant work experience, with skills being more important than the specific industry

The ability to use data analytics to make better business decisions is a valuable skill that’s in high demand. Freelance data analysts are capable of working with large volumes of data, processing it in its raw format, analyzing it, and arriving at certain conclusions for the purpose of organizational planning and problem-solving.

If you enjoy working with large volumes of data to glean insights designed to help client organizations with their decision-making, you might have what it takes to be a freelance data analyst on Upwork.

What does a freelance data analyst do?

Freelance data analysts work with client organizations by taking large volumes of data, cleaning it, interpreting it, and presenting it in order to answer a particular question or provide a solution to a problem. Data engineers typically work with computer software and programming languages like python to process data and deliver key insights to business analysts.

Data engineers also have a number of tools at their disposal, including SQL consoles, data modeling tools, statistical analysis tools, and business intelligence platforms. A number of business intelligence platforms, such as Tableau and Microsoft Power BI, enable freelance data analysts to deliver critical data and information in a way that is visually stunning and easily understood.

What skills do I need to become a freelance data analyst?

Clients hire freelance data analysts for their unique set of skills. When you’re on a freelance data analyst career path, no two clients or projects will be alike, but there are some common data analyst skills that clients look for in a data analyst role.

A data analyst job description will likely have some of these core traits:
• Critical thinking skills. While freelance data analysts use the latest technology and software to glean helpful information from complex data, meaningful insights and solutions would not be possible without first possessing critical thinking skills.
• Data visualization skills. Data visualization allows freelancers to present complex information with shapes, sizes, colors, and text, allowing clients to grasp information quickly and make key decisions without delay.
• Programming capability. While freelance data analysts aren’t required to be hard-core computer programmers, having familiarity with certain programming languages and being able to handle a straightforward programming fix is an invaluable skill to have.
• Familiarity with SQL. Large volumes of data sets and database work go hand-in-hand. By knowing their way around an SQL database, freelance data analysts can maximize their value, creating client solutions that handle large volumes of data efficiently and through easy-to-use desktop database tools.
• Problem-solving skills. Data analysis and problem-solving are virtually interchangeable. Freelancers that excel in problem-solving always find solutions to their client’s most pressing dilemmas. Whether through an SQL database or an interactive dashboard, data analysts can use their problem-solving skills to find answers to the toughest client questions.
• Project management skills. Whether building an SQL database or processing data through a business intelligence tool, project management skills are an essential capability for competitive freelance data analysts. Successfully shepherding a project from market research to product development will help you be that much more desirable to future clients.
• Attention to detail. When dealing with data, one wrong number can invalidate all conclusions and recommendations from a data set. It’s incumbent upon the freelance data engineers to make sure they pay attention to things like types of data and data sources to make sure the insights they’re gleaming are correct.

What are the core freelance data analyst job responsibilities?

While analyzing data and presenting findings are perhaps the most important responsibilities, there are other tasks data analysts take on when hired for various projects.

The core responsibilities freelance data analysts typically handle during an engagement include the following:
• Collect and analyze customer data to determine product and services preferences
• Oversee deployments regarding new processes and data fields for production
• Develop and manage all data visualization presentations for executive updates
• Technical skills to establish and maintain standardizations around data processing, analysis, and solution coding
• Ensure data accuracy used for reports and presentations
• Manage automated backup of all data housed across multiple database systems and engines.
• Collaborate with team members and other data scientists within the research department as well as stakeholders across the organization.

Should I get a degree or certification to become a freelance data analyst?

In addition to developing your skills via employer or client work, it is essential to obtain a degree and/or professional certification to help your Upwork profile stand out and ensure you have the most essential data analyst skills.

Some examples of popular freelance data analyst degrees or certifications include:
• Bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in data science, mathematics, finance, statistics, computer science, economics, psychology, management information systems, or an equivalent in a related field of study from an accredited college or university
• Certification of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences—offered by Columbia University Data Science Institute

Criteo is in search of a passionate, highly motivated Intern to join our Insights & Marketing Analytics (IMAX) team in Barcelona. The IMAX team is a specialized, global team of insights and analytics professionals located in Barcelona. This global team is responsible for the insights that fuel Criteo-created content; the creation, execution, and analysis of customer, shopper, and marketer surveys; the analysis of Criteo’s own paid media; and the evangelization of data-driven methods and data storytelling across all of Criteo. While the IMAX team directly supports the needs of the global Marketing team, we also interface with commercially-facing teams (such as Sales and Account Strategy), with Criteo clients, and with the marketplace itself via conferences, via the press, and via industry influencers.

You will be working closely with the global Marketing team to create the insights that fuel our message in the marketplace. You will contribute to the analysis behind some of our most important pieces of recurring and ad-hoc thought leadership. You will see your work directly cited in the press, at industry conferences, and by our commercial teams. Examples of such work are available on our website.
• Our Travel Reports at https://www.criteo.com/blog/global-travel-industry-trends-2024/
• Our ROAS Trap Report at https://go.criteo.com/en/the-roas-trap/
• Our Interactive Commerce Dashboard at: https://www.criteo.com/blog/commerce-trends-dashboard/
• And many exclusive deliverables for internal teams, clients, analysts and reporters.

You’ll work closely with the IMAX and Content teams to turn Criteo’s extraordinary commerce dataset into market-facing insights. You will also directly support Criteo’s in-house surveys of customers, shoppers, and marketers, on a global basis. You will create, launch, and maintain interactive tools using Tableau (or other technologies) that allow the broader set of global Criteos to access your work at scale.

The position combines traditional technical data analytics work, including the use of SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, with the “softer” part of data science: storytelling with data.

This position involves dealing with a considerable amount of complex, real-world data and requires a candidate who is comfortable thinking of new and innovative ways to analyze data and solve problems. The ideal candidate will be enthusiastic about data storytelling and embrace the concept of the “full stack” data analytics professional as a career choice.

What you will be doing

• Develop automations in Python to increase department efficiency and allow projects to scale

• Develop a deep knowledge of how to analyze trends across client, product groups, and verticals in all of Criteo’s global markets

• Understand how Criteo creates data across various data stores (Vertica / Hive / Presto). Become a point person regarding the meaning of data and best practices around data access.

• Contribute to new ways of using Criteo’s vast storehouse of data, including developing higher quality approaches to existing offerings as well as innovating to create new market-worthy content “from scratch.”

• Liaise with other teams as needed, including non-IMAX Analytics, Product Marketing, Sales, and Account Strategy

• Work with IMAX and Marketing team members to develop our strategic approach to content. Align our initiatives with Criteo’s overall direction and ensure that IMAX projects contribute to business results.

• This role will also provide the opportunity to create custom tables in databases, to support IMAX data for the global Criteo analytics community, to own and maintain reports/code in Tableau, Python or other relevant technologies.

Who You Are:

• Bachelor’s degree or higher in a quantitative field (Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Economics, etc.)

• Strong interest in combining analytical/technical skills with softer/communication skills

• Strong interest in AI solutions such as ChatGPT,Cursor, Perplexity.

• Relevant work experience, with skills being more important than the specific industry

• Strong communication skills in English

• Strong intellectual curiosity and ability to structure and solve difficult problems with minimal supervision

• Understanding of how to extract data from relational databases (i.e. SQL), including data which spans multiple tables

• Interest in internet advertising and, more broadly, in Marketing as a discipline.

• Knowledge of business intelligence tools: Excel / PivotTables / Tableau

• Some experience with Python, in both the context of creating automation and using Python for data analysis and visualization

We acknowledge that many candidates may not meet every single role requirement listed above. If your experience looks a little different from our requirements but you believe that you can still bring value to the role, we’d love to see your application!​

The ability to use data analytics to make better business decisions is a valuable skill that’s in high demand. Freelance data analysts are capable of working with large volumes of data, processing it in its raw format, analyzing it, and arriving at certain conclusions for the purpose of organizational planning and problem-solving.

If you enjoy working with large volumes of data to glean insights designed to help client organizations with their decision-making, you might have what it takes to be a freelance data analyst on Upwork.

What does a freelance data analyst do?

Freelance data analysts work with client organizations by taking large volumes of data, cleaning it, interpreting it, and presenting it in order to answer a particular question or provide a solution to a problem. Data engineers typically work with computer software and programming languages like python to process data and deliver key insights to business analysts.

Data engineers also have a number of tools at their disposal, including SQL consoles, data modeling tools, statistical analysis tools, and business intelligence platforms. A number of business intelligence platforms, such as Tableau and Microsoft Power BI, enable freelance data analysts to deliver critical data and information in a way that is visually stunning and easily understood.

What skills do I need to become a freelance data analyst?

Clients hire freelance data analysts for their unique set of skills. When you’re on a freelance data analyst career path, no two clients or projects will be alike, but there are some common data analyst skills that clients look for in a data analyst role.

A data analyst job description will likely have some of these core traits:
• Critical thinking skills. While freelance data analysts use the latest technology and software to glean helpful information from complex data, meaningful insights and solutions would not be possible without first possessing critical thinking skills.
• Data visualization skills. Data visualization allows freelancers to present complex information with shapes, sizes, colors, and text, allowing clients to grasp information quickly and make key decisions without delay.
• Programming capability. While freelance data analysts aren’t required to be hard-core computer programmers, having familiarity with certain programming languages and being able to handle a straightforward programming fix is an invaluable skill to have.
• Familiarity with SQL. Large volumes of data sets and database work go hand-in-hand. By knowing their way around an SQL database, freelance data analysts can maximize their value, creating client solutions that handle large volumes of data efficiently and through easy-to-use desktop database tools.
• Problem-solving skills. Data analysis and problem-solving are virtually interchangeable. Freelancers that excel in problem-solving always find solutions to their client’s most pressing dilemmas. Whether through an SQL database or an interactive dashboard, data analysts can use their problem-solving skills to find answers to the toughest client questions.
• Project management skills. Whether building an SQL database or processing data through a business intelligence tool, project management skills are an essential capability for competitive freelance data analysts. Successfully shepherding a project from market research to product development will help you be that much more desirable to future clients.
• Attention to detail. When dealing with data, one wrong number can invalidate all conclusions and recommendations from a data set. It’s incumbent upon the freelance data engineers to make sure they pay attention to things like types of data and data sources to make sure the insights they’re gleaming are correct.

What are the core freelance data analyst job responsibilities?

While analyzing data and presenting findings are perhaps the most important responsibilities, there are other tasks data analysts take on when hired for various projects.

The core responsibilities freelance data analysts typically handle during an engagement include the following:
• Collect and analyze customer data to determine product and services preferences
• Oversee deployments regarding new processes and data fields for production
• Develop and manage all data visualization presentations for executive updates
• Technical skills to establish and maintain standardizations around data processing, analysis, and solution coding
• Ensure data accuracy used for reports and presentations
• Manage automated backup of all data housed across multiple database systems and engines.
• Collaborate with team members and other data scientists within the research department as well as stakeholders across the organization.

Should I get a degree or certification to become a freelance data analyst?

In addition to developing your skills via employer or client work, it is essential to obtain a degree and/or professional certification to help your Upwork profile stand out and ensure you have the most essential data analyst skills.

Some examples of popular freelance data analyst degrees or certifications include:
• Bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in data science, mathematics, finance, statistics, computer science, economics, psychology, management information systems, or an equivalent in a related field of study from an accredited college or university
• Certification of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences—offered by Columbia University Data Science Institute

Early morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. Start your day having breakfast with the Team and grab fresh fruit on the way to your seat, in one of Porto’s most typical neighborhoods. This Purple Day is going to be a busy one: daily meeting ensuring all team members are on the same page regarding work status, priorities and blockers, language class and, just after, a Talent Management meeting with your manager, discussing your career path.

Lunch break. Today, your Team is onboarding newcomers, but also welcoming French colleagues: the perfect excuse to walk downtown and bond over a francesinha. When returning, inhale nature and peace of mind in Natixis Urban Garden (look at the crops; ready to harvest!).

Back inside. Brainstorming session on a new, exciting project in our disruptive and immersive Manaus Village. The afternoon went flying (tasks, meetings, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: celebrating cultural diversity with a Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.

Tomorrow, you attend a conference led by influential speakers in your industry and, the day after, you will work from home, benefitting from some focus time to complete that report and soft skills course on LinkedIn Learning.
